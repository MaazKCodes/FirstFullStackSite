                  <p>Info tech has undeniably crept into every corner of our lives, and libraries are no exception. I recall stepping into my local library just a few years ago, the musty scent of books wafting through the air, only to find myself confronted by a shiny new kiosk. Gone were the days of leafing through the card catalog or waiting for the librarian to check out my books. Today, I can't help but marvel at how libraries have morphed into tech-savvy information hubs, embracing the digital revolution to better serve their patrons.</p>
                 <p>And it's not just about fancy kiosks and self-checkout stations, either. Libraries have truly gone all-out, offering digital catalogs and e-books that can be accessed with a few swift taps of my finger. Never before has it been easier to dive into the works of Gladwell, Newport, or Hari, without even stepping foot outside my home. I've watched libraries evolve into modern community centers, providing not only a wealth of knowledge but also free Wi-Fi, public computers, and digital literacy programs. Gosh, it's a far cry from the hushed, dimly-lit spaces I once knew, and I can't help but feel a sense of wonder at how info tech has redefined what it means to visit the library. Below are some websites and blogs that discuss Info Tech in libraries!</p>
